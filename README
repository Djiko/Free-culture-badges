Free Culture Badges is a collection of badges on free culture and softwares. It has no other goal than providing a promotional material to the FLOSS Community.

How do I ask for a badge to be added ?
If you don't know how to create your own badge, we can do it for you. Just fill a request in the github project. We'll need a vector version (SVG or AI) of the software or free culture material you'd like us to add, as well as the URL of the website of your project.

What king of request do you accept ?
Every king of request related to free software or culture is a good candidate. By Free Software / culture, we mean any software meeting the FSF definition, or any piece of culture ()

Can I do my own badge ?
Except logos and trademarks, the other elements of the project are available under free culture licences. You can even use this design to create something completely different, as long as you respect the initial licence.
